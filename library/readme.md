## HD44780

This chipset (look wikipedia) is used for 1602 and 2004 displays. The package hd44780_I2Cexp (seems experimental) lets you easy control the display connected with 4 wires of I2C.

hd44780ioClass/hd44780_I2Cexp.h is the subfolder. Just write #include <hd44780ioClass/hd44780_I2Cexp.h> and done.

## Wire.h

Is automatically in the Arduino IDE integrated. Nothing to do here ...
